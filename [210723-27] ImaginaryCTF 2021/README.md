### Chicken Caesar Salad (Crypto, 50 pts)

**Description**

I remember the good old days when Caesar ciphers were easyâ€¦

**Attachments**

`chicken-caesar-salad.txt`; contains `qkbn{ePmv_lQL_kIMamZ_kQxpMZa_oMb_aW_pIZl}`

**Solution**

Go to any caesar cipher decoder (dcode.fr, for instance) and try all 25 combinations; the one with `ictf` as the first four letters is the flag.

**Flag**

```
ictf{wHen_dID_cAEseR_cIphERs_gEt_sO_hARd}
```

### Hidden | Forensics | 50

**Description**

Oh no, someone hid my flag behind a giant red block! Please help me retrieve it!!

**Attachments**

`challenge.psd`

**Solution**

`.psd` is a photoshop document file. Go to any editor (photopea.com, for instance) and open challenge.psd, then drag the red block to reveal the flag.

Or do `strings challenge.psd | grep ictf` to get the flag.

Wait, I thought format strings were only in C???

`stonks.py`

**Solution**

`stonks.py`:
``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

art = '''
                                         88

`"YbbdP"'   "Y888 `"YbbdP"'  88       88 88   `Y8a `"YbbdP"'
'''

flag = open("flag.txt").read()

class stonkgenerator: # I heard object oriented programming is popular
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def __str__(self):
        return "stonks"

def main():
    print(art)
    print("Welcome to Stonks as a Service!")
    print("Enter any input, and we'll say it back to you with any '{a}' replaced with 'stonks'! Try it out!")
    while True:
        inp = input("> ")
        print(inp.format(a=stonkgenerator()))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

As from the name of the challenge and the description, the python code has a format string to our input: `inp.format(a=stonkgenerator())`. Python functions have a `__globals__` attribute (see [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy)), which is a dictionary holding the global variables of the function. Since `stonkgenerator` is a class with an `__init__` and `__str__` methods, we can use those to get access to the global variable `flag`.
